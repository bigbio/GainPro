# Generative Proteomics 

gainpro is a Python package for missing value imputation in proteomics datasets. 

It leverages generative models to accurately estimate missing values, improving downstream analysis and data quality.

## Features

- Imputation algorithms tailored for proteomics data
- Easy integration with existing proteomics workflows
- User-friendly API and documentation

## How to use

In this package, you can find several directories, each one of them with a different content to be tested/used.

Each one of the directories is labelled with a number, to indicate the order each one should be used.

Inside each directory, you can find all the materials needed for it to work, including datasets, instructions and code.
